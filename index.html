                The goal of the project is to develop a scalable network of sensors that provide a novel method of tracking
                flood in urban regions. My role in the project is to add additional sensor functionality through the use of a
                static rain-gauge and develop the backend infrastructure to support data persistence and processing.
                <br><br>
                Sensor Development:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Integrated additional sensor function by implementing precipitation sensor by modifying the microcontroller configuration to allow for an additional serial device.
                    <li> Assisted in the implementation of LoRaWAN functionality by rewriting sensor firmware for periodic polling with LoRaWAN network.
                </ul>
                <br>
                Backend Development:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Designed backend infrastructure to allow for horizontal scaling across stateless services (API service and mapping webservice).
                    <li> Utilized the Flask micro-framework for API access to the persistence of sensor data.
                    <li> Designed database schema to persist various domain model objects such as sensors and sensordata.
                    <li> Utilized PostgreSQL for the atomic operations during the persistence of data to support a high number of concurrent read/write operations from sensors and users.
                    <li> Utilized nginx to loadbalance across multiple Flask instances.
                    <li> Deployed using Docker to allow for inter-container networking and consistent deployment using Docker Compose.
                    <li> Utilized Folium and Plotly for data visualization on the mapping webserver.
